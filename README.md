# CSC446 Final Project
### Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Restaurant Reviews
Authors: Natalie Hildreth, Ivan Ramos Candelero,and Jennifer Galicia-Torres 

## Description
This project implements Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification (ABSA) for restaurant reviews while also implementing word embedding and language modeling. Our restaurant review dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/restaurant-reviews. Our language modeling system identifies sentiment polarity (positive/neutral/negative) for specific aspects like food, service, and ambiance within customer reviews. Our implementation focuses on fine-grained sentiment analysis at the aspect level rather than document-level sentiment.

## Key Features:
- Sentiment Word Embedding
- Language Modeling Tokenized Reviews
- Sentiment Analysis of Given Reviews
